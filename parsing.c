// The parser validates syntax and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) 
// representing command structure. It ensures proper operator placement and quote matching.

// Key Responsibilities:
// Syntax validation (no consecutive operators, balanced quotes)
// AST construction for execution planning
// Error detection and reporting
// Command grouping for pipes and redirections
